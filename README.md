## 📂 Included Labs

### **1. MD5 Collision Detection**
**File:** `MD5 Collision.pdf`  
This lab demonstrates the weakness of the MD5 hashing algorithm by generating and validating collisions between different files.

**Key Takeaways**
- Understanding the MD5 hashing process  
- Demonstrating real hash collisions  
- Using `md5sum` to verify identical digests  
- Why MD5 is deprecated in modern cryptography  
- Well-documented analysis with screenshots and command outputs

### **2. XSS Attack simulation (XSS Attack)**
**File:** `XSS-Attack.pdf`  
A complete walkthrough of exploiting and mitigating Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in the Elgg social networking system.

**Covered Tasks**
- Basic XSS injection (`<script>alert("XSS")</script>`)
- Stored XSS in profile fields  
- Cookie stealing using JavaScript and Netcat  
- Samy-style self-replicating worm  
- Automatic friend-adding worm  
- DOM-based XSS explanation  
- Restoring server-side protections using `htmlspecialchars()`  

**Skills Demonstrated**
- Reflected, stored, and DOM-based XSS  
- Session hijacking through cookie exfiltration  
- Crafting malicious JavaScript payloads  
- Building self-propagating worms  
- Understanding CSRF-like behaviors with Elgg tokens  
- Hardening applications using output encoding and sanitization
