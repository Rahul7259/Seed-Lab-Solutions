This repository contains SEED lab solutions:

**1:** MD5 Collision Detection

- `MD5_Collision_Report.pdf` — The complete lab report (PDF) containing:
  - Objective and short background on MD5
  - Steps performed (commands executed) — screenshots included as proof
  - Verification showing identical MD5 digests for two different files (pre-generated examples)
  - Analysis, conclusions, and recommended mitigations

## How to review

1. Open `MD5_Collision_Report.pdf` in your browser or PDF reader.
2. The screenshots inside the PDF show the actual `md5sum` (or equivalent) outputs and differences between the files.
3. The report documents the verification commands used — you can re-run those verification commands on **instructor-provided** or otherwise vetted example files in an isolated environment.
