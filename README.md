## 🧠 Skills Learned

- Understanding the **MD5 hashing algorithm** and its weaknesses  
- Performing **collision detection and verification** using `md5sum`  
- Gaining insight into **cryptographic hash properties**: preimage resistance, second-preimage resistance, and collision resistance  
- Learning **why MD5 is deprecated** in modern cryptography  
- Documenting lab work with **screenshots, command outputs, and analysis**  
- Strengthening understanding of **secure alternatives** such as SHA-256, SHA-3, and HMAC
